It's a work in progress. I change it up a bunch and test out new things I learn in here. I have made about 4 different sites now.

Only domain I pay for at the moment so I just push the new projects.

> My new site currently includes HQ photos and navigation along with parallax scrollers (going for the Apple website feel).

> actually its more or less my business card now... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
